## Repository operating guide

Read README.md, LOG.md and FOUNDER.md first, then ARCHITECTURE.md and ROADMAP.md. Existing detailed product and verification instructions in this repository still apply.

### Working area

app/: Next.js routes; lib/ and data/: supporting logic and datasets; PLAN.md, DATA-SOURCES.md and HOW-IT-WORKS.md: product/data specifications.

### Setup and checks

Use [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the exact package directories and commands. Inspect package manifests before running commands. Use the existing lockfile; do not switch package managers or regenerate locks incidentally. Run checks appropriate to changed behavior and report failures honestly. A documentation check is not a product acceptance test.

### Boundaries

Distinguish supplied datasets from current verified information. Preserve source attribution. Do not silently resolve the outstanding party-focused versus neutral positioning decision.

Preserve pre-existing user changes. Never put credentials, personal data, local databases or generated build output in commits. Do not run paid-provider calls, publish, deploy, push, or mutate real service data without task authorization.

### Compass handoff

Keep root LOG.md and FOUNDER.md. Under `## Status`, keep one-line bullets named `State`, `Live URL`, `Stranger test`, `Currently working on`, and `Blocked on investor`. Use state `active`, `parked`, or `dormant` according to product activity, not the age of a documentation edit. Use `nothing` when no user decision or input is required; engineering work belongs in current work/roadmap.

Before ending meaningful work, update status and prepend a `- YYYY-MM-DD: ...` entry under `## Session notes`, newest first. Include the change, checks actually run, and remaining work. Preserve historical entries and decisions. Never record secrets or personal transcripts in this file.
